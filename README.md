# +HackS

+HackS is the project which we as a team developed to resolve the issue which hackers face while attending the hackathons. We have tried to cover the Chatting Part and the Meeting Part in our application so, hackers don't have to rely on any other platforms like Google Meet, Google Chat and Slack.

The web application is developed using HTML, CSS and ReactJs.

## Features

- HTML part consists of the Front-End part of the website.
- Chat_app consists the reactJs part of Chats+.
- Webric-video-room-master consists the Meets+.
